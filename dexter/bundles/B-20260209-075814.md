### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF price sweeps Sellside Liquidity below a low and breaks higher with momentum and displacement | THEN look for Fair Value Gaps (FVG) between Displacement High and Displacement Low as confirmation of a Bullish Market Structure Shift (MSS) | 14:32 |
| S-002 | IF price runs Buyside Liquidity and rallies into a Higher Timeframe (HTF) PDA like a Bearish Order Block or FVG | THEN look for a sharp rejection and energetic move below the Displacement Low, leaving imbalance | 14:32 |
| S-003 | IF price runs liquidity and reverses during a Lower Timeframe (LTF) move but the Higher Timeframe (HTF) is still directional | THEN expect price to continue in the HTF direction, trapping early buyers or sellers | 14:32 |
| S-004 | IF price runs below the AR Low into a 15/60min Bullish PDA during the London Killzone (LOKZ) | THEN look for a clear 5min Market Structure Shift Higher with imbalance as confirmation of a potential Low Of The Day (LOTD) | 14:32 |
| S-005 | IF price forms a Liquidity Pool at the Displacement High and there are opposing Higher Timeframe (HTF) PDA’s | THEN wait for more confirmation or a second retracement to determine if it’s a trap or a valid Market Structure Shift | 14:32 |
| S-006 | IF DXY runs Buyside Liquidity and goes lower but EURUSD forms a higher low instead of a lower low (SMT Divergence) | THEN look for a quick move higher in EURUSD as confirmation of a Market Structure Shift (MSS) | 14:32 |
| S-007 | IF price moves slowly towards a 60min FVG and sharply drops below an old low into the FVG | THEN expect a parabolic move higher targeting Buyside Liquidity | 14:32 |
| S-008 | IF price forms a Balanced Price Range (BPR) inside the Displacement High/Low range after a sharp Stop Run and displacement | THEN refine the area using unconventional timeframes (e.g., 8min/10min) and look for overlapping confluence as a high-probability area | 14:32 |
