### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF bias is bullish aiming for buyside liquidity and next 60min candle opens | THEN want to see price push higher above previous hourly candle high | 0:00-1:18 |
| S-002 | IF bullish bias and next 60min candle opens | THEN want price to retrace straight away for 5min entry | 0:00-1:18 |
| S-003 | IF 5min entry taken inside previous 60min candle range and price goes lower giving clear direction right away | THEN price leaves the most clues for trade validation | 1:18 |
| S-004 | IF after next hourly candle open price pushes higher above previous 60min candle high before retracing to 5min entry | THEN need to be way more careful and patient with entries | 1:18 |
| S-005 | IF price is held in a range and range develops while price starts pulling with clear equal lows/highs | THEN low resistance liquidity forms and liquidity is being built | mini-lesson |
| S-006 | IF low resistance liquidity areas exist | THEN price will visit those areas later and collect the liquidity before going for a major move | mini-lesson |
| S-007 | IF price does something drastic that clears the liquidity in a range | THEN range gets invalidated and no more liquidity to run | mini-lesson |
| S-008 | IF range gets invalidated by liquidity clear | THEN price begins building sellside liquidity in new direction | mini-lesson |
| S-009 | IF price uses low resistance liquidity | THEN expect expansion right away | mini-lesson |
| S-010 | IF low resistance liquidity run is strong enough | THEN causes a shift in structure | mini-lesson |
