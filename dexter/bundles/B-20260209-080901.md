### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF price forms a liquidity void (sharp one-sided move with large candles) | THEN expect price to return and fill the void (fair valuation) | Liquidity Void section |
| S-002 | IF price fills a liquidity void and crosses equilibrium into opposing dealing range side | THEN look for reaction areas (SIBI, breaker, FVG+OB combinations) | Liquidity Void section |
| S-003 | IF price forms a FVG in discount side of dealing range and gets aggressively broken with momentum | THEN expect retest of FVG to act as resistance (short-term premium) | Fair Value Gaps retail break & retest logic |
| S-004 | IF price strongly trends leaving FVGs/BISIs and doesn't close below CE (midpoint) | THEN expect continuation after retesting CE area | CE - Consequent Encroachment |
| S-005 | IF price aggressively closes below CE of FVG/BISI and fully fills the gap | THEN watch for bearish pressure and potential sellside liquidity raid | CE - Consequent Encroachment |
| S-006 | IF a filled FVG (30-40 days old) aligns with current PDA levels | THEN consider it as strong confluence for potential reversal | Fair Value Gap stays sensitive for almost 2 months |
