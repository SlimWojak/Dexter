### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF price takes Sell Side Liquidity into bullish PDAs and leaves the strong low with momentum | THEN longer term vision is bullish, targeting marked highs above | 3M Analysis |
| S-002 | IF bullish order block has taken out BSLQ with overlapping bullish FVG | THEN classify as high probability bullish order block | 3M Analysis |
| S-004 | IF price retraces into bullish PDAs and rejects | THEN expect continuation to the upside (ideal scenario) | 3M Analysis |
| S-005 | IF price taps into bearish FVG above and reacts from there | THEN expect pullback 9 out of 10 times | Monthly Analysis |
| S-006 | IF price is in dealing range AND above midpoint | THEN price could go all the way into dealing range discount area (below midpoint) | Monthly Analysis |
| S-007 | IF equal lows formation near PML AND lack of taking out opposite swing low | THEN indicates weakness in the low | Daily Analysis |
| S-008 | IF price is in discount area of daily range AND clean bearish order flow from highs | THEN look for bearish continuation towards Daily IFVG high (Area 1) | Daily Analysis |
| S-009 | IF price breaks and retests IFVG | THEN target Daily MMSM Low (Area 2) | Daily Analysis |
| S-010 | IF 4hr is in clear bearish order flow AND price reaches 4hr area of interest | THEN look for 15min rejection and order flow change | 4HR Analysis |
| S-011 | IF price is bearish AND currently inside and holding 1hr bearish FVG | THEN price could reject FVG now and start building bearish order flow OR go higher into 4hr levels | 1HR Analysis |
| S-012 | IF price taps into 1hr order block AND makes a strong high AND quickly rejects it | THEN look for entries as soon as 15min order flow has switched bearish | 15MIN Analysis |
| S-013 | IF 15min bullish pullback order flow still intact AND no strong high created | THEN wait for 15min order flow switch before entry | 15MIN Analysis |
