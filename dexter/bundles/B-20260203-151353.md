### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF price moves away from a swing low | THEN expect sell-side liquidity (stop orders) below that low | 30s |
| S-002 | IF price moves away from a swing high | THEN expect buy-side liquidity (stop orders) above that high | 30s |
| S-003 | IF price moves from an old high | THEN there will be liquidity resting above that old high | 271s |
| S-004 | IF price moves from an old low | THEN there will be liquidity resting below that old low | 271s |
| S-005 | IF market encounters thick resistance (multiple old lows/highs) before reaching a significant old high | THEN it is a low probability condition for longs due to high resistance | 400s |
| S-006 | IF market makes higher highs and higher lows | THEN it cannot reasonably drop straight down to run sell stops below old low without first encountering higher lows/highs | 520s |
| S-007 | IF price breaks below an old low with sharp one-way direction and minimal retracements | THEN consider the area between the broken low and the next short-term high as low resistance liquidity run | 511s |
| S-008 | IF market breaks through a short-term high after violating a low | THEN expect climb back into range with buy stops above short-term highs providing liquidity | 680s |
| S-009 | IF black swan event (e.g., FOMC, NFP) occurs | THEN expect price to cut through resistance/support levels to reach distant liquidity | 550s |
| S-010 | IF a new short-term high is formed before a low is retreated to or retested as resistance | THEN buy-side liquidity will form above these old highs | 754s |
| S-011 | IF price breaks below a short-term low and forms a retracement | THEN sell-stop liquidity will form below the short-term low | 754s |
| S-012 | IF price breaks above a short-term high and market structure is bullish | THEN price will have very little resistance to trade back down to the point where the short-term high was broken | 754s |
| S-013 | IF price breaks below a short-term low and expands | THEN price will have very little resistance to trade back down to the point where the short-term low was broken | 754s |
| S-014 | IF price forms a short-term low during a bearish bias | THEN expect sell stop liquidity to be resting below those lows | 995s |
| S-015 | IF market has a longer-term high to the left and takes out a low | THEN this is a low resistance liquidity run (bearish continuation) | 995s |
| S-016 | IF price fails to get above a swing high after violating old lows | THEN institutional order flow turns bearish and expands downside | 995s |
| S-017 | IF price rallies into a defended high during bearish bias | THEN this becomes a low resistance liquidity run for downside continuation | 995s |
| S-018 | IF bearish bias is confirmed with defended highs | THEN focus on rallies as opportunities to take out short-term lows | 995s |
| S-019 | IF market identifies old lows with resting liquidity below | THEN expect price to expand down through those levels after retracement | 995s |
| S-020 | IF price sweeps liquidity below equal lows during retracement | THEN expect expansion down to take out stops below old lows | 1236s |
| S-021 | IF market creates consolidation after making long-term low | THEN expect rally through consolidation with low resistance | 1302s |
| S-022 | IF price retraces higher in bearish environment | THEN expect another leg down aiming to violate lows | 1385s |
| S-023 | IF market trades down with small retracement | THEN expect low resistance run above old highs | 1450s |
