### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF price leaves the consolidation | THEN and only then do we consider looking to lower our protective stop-loss and I'll just bring that over here a little bit and we don't go anything more towards an auto trade entry until we start seeing price back | 22:57 |
| S-002 | IF the market moves in trending environments where it moves directionally | THEN the market goes into consolidation and then it trends again well those two conditions are very easy to see if you just relax and try not to over | 2:50 |
| S-003 | IF we want to be trading in an immediate term momentum and it's exactly where the banks are we looking at that time frame | THEN it goes without saying that there should be a high probability of well confluence with that idea and what we see in price | 4:58 |
| S-004 | IF the 10 period has not crossed over the red though so as soon as this occurs and | THEN the 10 period trades below or marks below the 20-period moving average if we got that cross over we can't take too long ok so we'll have the Fibonacci here | 11:18 |
| S-005 | IF consolidations occur if we take that trade we want to leave our stop loss in until we start leaving the consolidation ok and | THEN we can start trailing it up behind to swing lows from market action and I'll explain that in a second but taking | 12:47 |
| S-006 | IF we take that trade we want to leave our stop loss in until we start leaving the consolidation ok and | THEN we can start trailing it up behind to swing lows from market action and I'll explain that in a second but taking a portion off here and then letting the | 12:50 |
