### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF price makes one-sided delivery into premium AND we have a bullish bias | THEN look for bearish breaker formation (last significant down candle before BSL sweep) | N/A |
| S-002 | IF price makes one-sided delivery into discount AND we have a bearish bias | THEN look for bullish breaker formation | N/A |
| S-003 | IF breaker forms at the beginning of a run | THEN do NOT trade it (low probability, likely to move into opposing LTF PD array) | N/A |
| S-004 | IF high probability OB for opposing direction has engulfing candle close through and above/below it | THEN identify this as a breaker block | N/A |
| S-005 | IF breaker is validated (correct P/D side, not at beginning of run) | THEN treat and approach them the same as order blocks for entry | N/A |
| S-006 | IF entry is taken below 50% of dealing range (M/T marked) | THEN stop loss tunes into breakeven plus | N/A |
