### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF price trades up into and just above the FVG high | THEN expect price to break down and trade back into the FVG range | 529s |
| S-002 | IF price remains below a long-term high framed by higher timeframe resistance | THEN expect the long-term high to remain intact and price not to go higher | 529s |
| S-003 | IF price trades down to the discount level of the low end of the FVG | THEN expect price to find support and rally back up | 529s |
| S-004 | IF price breaks down and consolidates, forming a potential bull flag | THEN expect it to be a false bull flag and fade the pattern | 529s |
| S-005 | IF price rebalances an imbalance by rallying back up | THEN label the swing high in your mind | 529s |
| S-006 | IF price rebalances an imbalance by forming a swing high | THEN label it as an intermediate term high | 774s |
| S-007 | IF price rebalances an imbalance by forming a swing low | THEN label it as an intermediate term low | 774s |
| S-008 | IF an intermediate term low forms by rebalancing | THEN expect higher short-term lows to the left and right of it | 774s |
| S-009 | IF price forms a fair value gap and rebalances | THEN classify it as an intermediate term high | 774s |
| S-010 | IF price trades back to the high of a candle that created a small imbalance | THEN that is your aggressive entry | 1534s |
| S-011 | IF a short-term low and intermediate-term low are taken out | THEN look to target the previous long-term high or long-term low | 1829s |
| S-012 | IF price goes up into an imbalance on the daily chart | THEN expect it to rebalance and trade lower | 1534s |
| S-013 | IF price breaks below an interim term low | THEN use Fibonacci anchored from the interim term high to the long-term low for projection targets | 1800s |
| S-014 | IF price forms a fair value gap (FVG) with a breakdown in an up-close candle series | THEN look for short entry without needing a swing low broken, only short-term low being broken (Market Structure Shift) | 2080s-2365s |
| S-015 | IF intermediate-term high is not higher than two short-term highs | THEN market is very weak (algorithm tipping its hand) | 2080s-2365s |
| S-016 | IF price goes up into a formed imbalance after a Market Structure Shift | THEN consider short entry (or vice versa for bullish scenarios) | 2080s-2365s |
| S-017 | IF price rebalances an imbalance and forms an intermediate-term high | THEN the next short-term high should be lower than that intermediate-term high | 2338s |
| S-018 | IF price trades higher than an intermediate-term high | THEN your trade idea is probably flawed and you should wait for market structure to realign | 2338s |
| S-019 | IF price trades into an order block after breaking below it | THEN this is a classic low-risk high confirmation short entry | 2618s |
| S-020 | IF price forms an intermediate-term high with lower short-term highs to the left and right | THEN it is classified as an intermediate-term high | 2338s |
| S-021 | IF price forms consecutive up-closed candles creating an order block within bearish market structure | THEN expect failure to break above the interim high | 2598s |
| S-022 | IF price trades into the top end of a higher timeframe FVG during volatile conditions | THEN allow for minor overshoots without invalidating the level | 2754s |
| S-023 | IF an imbalance gets rebalanced forming a high in bearish structure | THEN that high should not be violated by price going higher | 2889s |
| S-024 | IF you're bearish and price trades up into bullish candles (up closed candles) | THEN those up closed candles should act as resistance and prevent price from going higher | 2871s |
| S-025 | IF price violates an intermediate-term high (key high) after an imbalance rebalance | THEN your bearish idea is wrong and you should cancel the trade | 3138s |
| S-026 | IF you're bullish and price trades down into down closed candles | THEN those down closed candles should act as support (bullish order block) | 3138s |
| S-027 | IF price trades back down to down-closed candles in a bullish swing | THEN expect them to act as support structure for an order block | 3111s |
| S-028 | IF intermediate term high is broken after a bearish trade idea | THEN exit and wait for new setups (same session/day/week) | 3111s |
| S-029 | IF down-closed candle is overlapped (broken below) in a bullish swing | THEN it's only valid if there's a proximate short-term low to take sell stops before reaccumulation | 3111s |
| S-030 | IF trading against the daily chart's directional bias | THEN expect failure (though not impossible) | 3382s |
