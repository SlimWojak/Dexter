### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF price sweeps liquidity below equal lows during London killzone | THEN look for displacement and FVG formation for long entry | 14:32 |
| S-002 | IF price sweeps liquidity below equal lows | THEN anticipate a MSS (Market Structure Shift) when price rallies above the high | 12:19 |
| S-003 | IF a candle creates a FVG after a MSS | THEN look to trade at the earliest in the FVG | 12:19 |
| S-004 | IF price is inside a FVG and aligns with the opening price of an OB | THEN place a buy limit order at the OB open price plus spread | 12:19 |
| S-005 | IF price sweeps above London session highs or below London session lows during 2:00-5:00 AM NY time | THEN expect potential setups from the resulting price action | 1943s |
| S-006 | IF intraday high/low forms right before 9:30 AM NY equities open | THEN monitor for potential liquidity sweeps | 1943s |
| S-007 | IF price sweeps stops above old highs or below old lows between 8:30 AM - noon NY time | THEN look for subsequent market structure shift on 1-3 minute charts | 2242s |
| S-008 | IF short-term higher low with stops above forms inside a price leg | THEN identify as internal range liquidity | 2242s |
| S-009 | IF price trades down to lower FVG and comes back up into higher FVG | THEN enter long in higher FVG with expectation lower FVG won't be retested | 40:26 |
| S-010 | IF price runs into upper rectangle before dropping to green FVG | THEN nix the trade and move to sidelines | 40:26 |
| S-011 | IF price creates a tail candle after moving back into higher FVG | THEN interpret as running for lower imbalance and expect accumulation | 40:26 |
