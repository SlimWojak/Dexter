### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF price is at 60 minute FVG that aligns with SMT divergence in premium zone | THEN this is a Smart Money Reversal setup for low risk short entry | 3:29 |
| S-002 | IF price breaks below original consolidation after distribution | THEN expect price to return to original consolidation zone and reprice for sellside liquidity | 3:29 |
| S-004 | IF price forms breaker after 1st stage distribution | THEN look for order block at 2nd stage redistribution for continuation short | 3:29 |
| S-005 | IF 2nd stage reaccumulation forms with +FVG at CE (consequent encroachment) | THEN this provides entry for continuation toward buyside liquidity | 3:29 |
| S-006 | IF shorts are trapped below original consolidation in discount zone | THEN price rallies through balanced price range toward buyside liquidity | 3:29 |
| S-007 | IF Market Maker Sell Model is in play with H1 bias bearish | THEN expect original consolidation to be revisited as loss (broken support becomes target) | 3:29 |
| S-008 | IF stophunt occurs above higher high (HH) in ascending structure | THEN do not buy at higher low (HL) after stophunt - reversal is in play | 3:29 |
