| S-001 | IF you subscribe to the channel and | THEN when you subscribe to the channel you want to toggle all notifications you want to click that little uh I think it's like a bell icon and then all notifications that way anytime I post my community tab | 7:22 |
| S-002 | IF whether you're going to be expecting that Weekly candle to expand higher or lower | THEN weekly bi but then you have to go into the daily chart and figure out basically where you are in the grand scheme of things on that Weekly range expanding higher or | 16:59 |
| S-003 | IF that Weekly candle to expand higher or lower | THEN weekly bi but then you have to go into the daily chart and figure out basically where you are in the grand scheme of things on that Weekly range expanding higher or lower because we're looking for lower | 17:00 |
| S-004 | IF they sold on a break trying to be a breakout artist and | THEN the algorithms go right back up to an area where it's been cleanly delivered relative equal highs see how this High here right before it dropped is basically the same high here | 24:08 |
| S-006 | IF pretty cool sounds neat and all that but watch what it is this here | THEN range this is the low of the day and this is the high of the day thus far so if we take that range and split it from the low to the high to get the midpoint all this can be determined by a simple 50 | 35:25 |
| S-007 | IF watch what it is this here | THEN range this is the low of the day and this is the high of the day thus far so if we take that range and split it from the low to the high to get the midpoint all this can be determined by a simple 50 level on a Fibonacci so you drag your | 35:27 |
| S-008 | IF you're bearish you're looking for buy stops to be ran | THEN a break-in Market structure lower a short-term low being broken that's what it looks like right here shortterm swing low we have a candle High I'm sorry a candle higher to | 43:15 |
| S-009 | IF you have that and | THEN you have a break below that if it happens that creates a gap like this that's what you're looking for when it trades up into that you can go short or if you want to use cell stops you can use a cell stop in this candle here and | 43:37 |
| S-010 | IF on a lower time frame once that occurs and you have an imbalance | THEN trigger okay and then you split that range that was created find out where the 50% is and then if you're selling short you want to find something like an old low or an imbalance to aim for as | 47:49 |
| S-011 | IF and you have an imbalance | THEN trigger okay and then you split that range that was created find out where the 50% is and then if you're selling short you want to find something like an old low or an imbalance to aim for as your Target and you want to get the | 47:52 |
| S-012 | IF there is a trade on long it'll reverse and take you the other direction okay and | THEN this one here this is a reversal as well then another another close and then another long entry the exit a short | 4:05 |
| S-013 | IF you subscribe to the channel you want to toggle all notifications you want to click that little uh I think it's like a bell icon and | THEN all notifications that way anytime I post my community tab it'll let you know otherwise it won't | 7:25 |
| S-014 | IF I say draw to think of it as price being a paperclip okay and | THEN you you have this magnetic impulse that specifically price levels and seasonality okay will put on price it'll cause price to gravitate towards certain levels and the | 14:45 |
| S-015 | IF right here you have to have an assumption whether you're going to be expecting that Weekly candle to expand higher or lower | THEN weekly bi but then you have to go into the daily chart and figure out basically where you are in | 16:55 |
| S-016 | IF assumption whether you're going to be expecting that Weekly candle to expand higher or lower | THEN weekly bi but then you have to go into the daily chart and figure out basically where you are in the grand scheme of things on that | 16:57 |
| S-017 | IF objective well I'm going to teach you the liquidity Matrix okay and sounds pretty cool sounds neat and all that but watch what it is this here | THEN range this is the low of the day and this is the high of the day thus far so if we take that range and split it from the | 35:19 |
| S-018 | IF the liquidity Matrix okay and sounds pretty cool sounds neat and all that but watch what it is this here | THEN range this is the low of the day and this is the high of the day thus far so if we take that range and split it from the low to the high to get the midpoint all | 35:22 |
| S-019 | IF the algorithm is in a sell program and it's going lower it does not matter it's going to repic lower and lower and lower and | THEN what will happen is those buyers that may come in with a huge influx of volume they're going to get crushed and they get squeezed you ever | 36:40 |
| S-020 | IF you want to use cell stops you can use a cell stop in this candle here and this let it trip you in and | THEN use the high of that candle as your stop that may be too wide for you but I I mentioned the logic around this is you're using a micro okay micros aren't | 43:49 |
| S-021 | IF you learn how to do something like this and you're able to pull down this number of handles and | THEN you have sound money management nothing compares to it folks these are the things that I use when you watched on when I was on Twitter and I | 44:35 |
| S-022 | IF you're looking for lower prices your focus is on a run above an old high once that forms | THEN you're looking for a break- in Market structure on a lower time frame once that occurs and you have an imbalance that's your trigger okay and then you split that | 47:40 |
| S-023 | IF old high once that forms then you're looking for a break- in Market structure on a lower time frame once that occurs and you have an imbalance | THEN trigger okay and then you split that range that was created find out where the 50% is and then if you're selling | 47:45 |
| S-024 | IF looking for a break- in Market structure on a lower time frame once that occurs and you have an imbalance | THEN trigger okay and then you split that range that was created find out where the 50% is and then if you're selling short you want to find something like an | 47:48 |
| S-025 | IF you were going to trade one full contract of the NASDAQ futures most Brokers unless you're using a discount broker they're going to require you to have Deep Pockets and sense that you're going to have that about $177 | THEN 000 and about 12,000 and a | 5:50 |
| S-026 | IF you do get a run of profitability soon as you get a losing trade it's going to blow your mind and you're going to want to correct it quickly and you're going to start making irrational decisions and | THEN you enter that loser cycle I've talked about | 16:05 |
| S-027 | IF okay so majority of your analysis should really be linked to this time frame right here you have to have an assumption whether you're going to be expecting that Weekly candle to expand higher or lower | THEN weekly bi but then you | 16:51 |
| S-028 | IF really be linked to this time frame right here you have to have an assumption whether you're going to be expecting that Weekly candle to expand higher or lower | THEN weekly bi but then you have to go into the daily chart and | 16:53 |
| S-029 | IF you see how many times this thing forms every single week okay it's many times throughout the intraday charts it creates this type of move but it runs the stops | THEN we have a short-term low and then it breaks below it so now we | 28:53 |
| S-030 | IF you try to get in especially if you like using Market order you may see it trade right to this low and say okay now I believe it's going to go down you put a market order in the sell short | THEN slippage gets you down here that creates | 34:02 |
| S-031 | IF you like using Market order you may see it trade right to this low and say okay now I believe it's going to go down you put a market order in the sell short | THEN slippage gets you down here that creates a larger area of risk that you have to | 34:03 |
| S-032 | IF have our entry pattern here what would you be looking for as a downside objective well I'm going to teach you the liquidity Matrix okay and sounds pretty cool sounds neat and all that but watch what it is this here | THEN range this is the low of the day and this is | 35:14 |
| S-033 | IF you be looking for as a downside objective well I'm going to teach you the liquidity Matrix okay and sounds pretty cool sounds neat and all that but watch what it is this here | THEN range this is the low of the day and this is the high of the day thus far so if we | 35:16 |
| S-034 | IF it trades up into that you can go short or if you want to use cell stops you can use a cell stop in this candle here and this let it trip you in and | THEN use the high of that candle as your stop that may be too wide for you but I I | 43:46 |
| S-035 | IF range so if you're looking for lower prices your focus is on a run above an old high once that forms then you're looking for a break- in Market structure on a lower time frame once that occurs and you have an imbalance | THEN trigger okay and then you split that | 47:40 |
| S-036 | IF prices your focus is on a run above an old high once that forms then you're looking for a break- in Market structure on a lower time frame once that occurs and you have an imbalance | THEN trigger okay and then you split that range that was created find out where | 47:42 |
