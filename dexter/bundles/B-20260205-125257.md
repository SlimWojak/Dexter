### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF we see this in proper context we can classify and quantify real support resistance because we're incorporating the idea of a stop run above this short term high and | THEN anyone that's long here we're going to have a stop below this low so they run | 6:29 |

### DELTA TO CANON (v0.2)
| Parameter | Current Phoenix Value | This Bundle Value | Change Type |
