### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF price trades below a swing low and takes out sell-side liquidity | THEN expect price to retrace back into the range between the high and low | 00:45 |
| S-002 | IF daily chart shows a market structure shift lower and price trades into a fair value gap | THEN anticipate lower prices with a bearish bias | 02:15 |
| S-003 | IF price consolidates around equilibrium | THEN it becomes difficult to determine bias without additional price action | 01:30 |
| S-004 | IF trading with a bearish bias | THEN utilize maximum leverage within risk tolerance for bearish moves | 03:00 |
| S-005 | IF price trades below old low and rallies above but does not trade above short-term high | THEN look for potential long entry | 10:04 |
| S-006 | IF price reaches midpoint of range with buy stops above | THEN consider taking profits | 733s |
| S-007 | IF price trades below old low and takes out sell-side liquidity | THEN look for MSS bullish shift and FVG formation | 1036 |
| S-008 | IF correlated assets (S&P, NASDAQ) move in tandem and S&P shows FVG | THEN use S&P FVG as entry signal for NASDAQ | 1036 |
| S-009 | IF price forms displacement low followed by displacement high | THEN look for FVG formation | 990s |
| S-010 | IF price trades into order block | THEN consider long entry in proximity to order block | 1036 |
| S-011 | IF price trades down into an old FVG in S&P | THEN use timing of that candle for long entry on NASDAQ | 1232s |
| S-012 | IF Dow refuses to make lower low while NASDAQ and S&P make lower lows | THEN confirm bullish bias in S&P | 1432s |
| S-013 | IF price trades below old low and shows bullish MSS in S&P | THEN look for higher prices | 1501s |
| S-014 | IF price runs above old highs while Dow does not make higher high | THEN look to set up short position | 1474s |
| S-015 | IF NASDAQ and S&P trade below old low while Dow is unwilling to go lower | THEN look for potential fake break and rally higher | 1474s |
| S-016 | IF price breaks swing high | THEN market structure has shifted | 1773s |
| S-017 | IF Dow holds above prior low while NASDAQ and S&P make new lows | THEN look for bullish divergence as potential signal | 1716s |
| S-018 | IF price breaks swing high after liquidity sweep | THEN market structure has shifted bullish | 1716s |
| S-019 | IF FVG forms after bullish MSS | THEN consider it as potential entry zone | 1716s |
| S-020 | IF entering trade during 9:30 NY open | THEN use small size (1 contract) to gauge price reaction | 2015s |
