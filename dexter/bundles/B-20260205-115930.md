### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF price has a one-sided expansion and then starts pulling back into the range that was created | THEN look for low resistance liquidity runs where price is likely to purge | N/A |
| S-002 | IF there is a lack of liquidity run or no clear direction to price (no equal lows/highs) | THEN price will gravitate towards those areas of unclear liquidity | N/A |
| S-004 | IF price is chopping and there is a lack of liquidity above (no clear EQH's) | THEN price will struggle to push higher | N/A |
| S-005 | IF a liquidity level (like Asian open high) is ran and collects liquidity | THEN price can then gap into a drive in the opposite direction | N/A |
| S-006 | IF price leaves low resistance liquidity after retracement | THEN price launches towards low resistance sell-side liquidity | N/A |
| S-007 | IF price enters low resistance liquidity area | THEN expect instant expansion right away | N/A |
| S-008 | IF a clear liquidity raid occurs before pushing in intended direction | THEN the choppy price action can resolve and price can make a major move | N/A |
