### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF DXY forms a higher high and EURUSD fails to form a lower low and instead forms a higher low | THEN expect a reversal to happen | N/A |
| S-002 | IF price reaches 60min Premium PDA | THEN look at the 15min TF & compare it with DXY 15min TF to see if there’s crack in correlation – SMT Divergence | N/A |
| S-003 | IF EURUSD forms a higher high when DXY fails to form a lower low and instead prints a higher low on 15min TF | THEN expect price to reverse | N/A |
| S-004 | IF price goes into the POI and 15min TF SMT Divergence acts as confirmation | THEN go back to the 60min TF and look for potential short opportunities targeting the sell side liquidity | N/A |
| S-005 | IF EURUSD runs the SSLQ and forms a lower low while DXY fails to run the BSLQ and instead forms a lower high | THEN be aware that a totally different scenario could occur | N/A |
