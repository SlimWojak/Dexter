### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF price forms a three-candle pattern where first candle's low is traded below by second candle, and third candle extends lower without trading back to first candle's low | THEN a bearish FVG (Fair Value Gap) is formed indicating sell-side order flow | 484s |
| S-002 | IF a bearish FVG forms above an old high | THEN it represents institutional sell-side order flow | 484s |
| S-003 | IF price runs above an old high then breaks down | THEN look for bearish ICT fair value gap pattern (candle 1 low > candle 2 low > candle 3 high) | 725s |
| S-004 | IF price trades back into FVG area (between candle 1 low and candle 3 high) | THEN short with expectation of continuation lower | 800s |
| S-005 | IF optimal bearish FVG forms after run into buy side liquidity (above old highs) | THEN prioritize these setups over random gap hunting | 900s |
| S-006 | IF price runs above single high or double top | THEN look for buy stops resting above as liquidity pool | 950s |
| S-007 | IF price runs above an old high then breaks below the old high and takes out a short-term low prior to that run | THEN a bearish market structure shift is confirmed | 966s - 1264s |
| S-008 | IF a bearish market structure shift occurs with displacement (energetic move closing below the low) | THEN hunt for fair value gaps within the displacement range | 966s - 1264s |
| S-009 | IF a fair value gap is identified (candle 1 low to candle 3 high) | THEN place limit order just above candle 3's high with stop above candle 1 or 2 | 966s - 1264s |
| S-010 | IF price breaks below a short-term low after running above an old high | THEN identify displacement low and displacement high | 1206s |
| S-011 | IF a bearish candle closes energetically below displacement low | THEN watch for FVG formation between displacement low and candle's high | 1302s |
| S-012 | IF no FVG forms between displacement low and displacement high | THEN do not take the trade | 1320s |
| S-013 | IF price trades below a low and creates another leg lower into sell stops | THEN look for a run higher that takes out a short-term high and closes above it | 1450s |
| S-014 | IF bullish displacement occurs after taking out a short-term high | THEN look for FVG between displacement high and displacement low | 1460s |
| S-015 | IF price trades below swing low and forms FVG | THEN enter short at candle high with stop above swing high | 1447s |
| S-016 | IF price breaks below short-term low and forms FVG | THEN enter short with stop above swing high | 1746s |
| S-017 | IF price breaks below short term low and forms a fair value gap on the 1-minute chart | THEN look for entry opportunities as price retraces into the FVG | 1688s |
| S-018 | IF price runs above a 15-minute high during NY session | THEN expect sell-off to target external range liquidity | 1802s |
| S-019 | IF daily chart shows extended bullish move | THEN adopt bearish bias for intraday trades expecting mean reversion | 1845s |
| S-020 | IF price breaks below swing low after running above 15-minute high | THEN look for FVG formation and enter short above candle high | 1929s |
| S-021 | IF FVG forms after price breaks swing low | THEN place limit order one tick above candle high for short entry | 1929s |
| S-022 | IF short entry is triggered | THEN place stop loss above swing high or candle high | 1929s |
| S-023 | IF price forms a swing high and creates a fair value gap between candle one's high and candle three's low | THEN take profits below the FVG at a discount level | 2171s |
| S-024 | IF price sweeps equal lows and creates a displacement | THEN target the draw on liquidity below the lows | 2471s |
| S-025 | IF price takes out a significant intermediate-term low | THEN you can roll your stop to that low | 2412s |
| S-026 | IF you take first partial profit | THEN do not trail stop aggressively | 2412s |
| S-027 | IF price sweeps liquidity below equal lows | THEN look for short entry | 2412s |
