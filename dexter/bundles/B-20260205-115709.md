### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF clear liquidity draw to target exists (usually Asia highs/lows) AND price did not take opposite side liquidity AND small 5min MMM is visible AND clear liquidity run occurred in this MMM | THEN 5min liquidity scalp setup is valid | N/A |
| S-002 | IF liquidity is taken with nice IFVG formation | THEN watch those IFVG developments for entry | N/A |
| S-004 | IF clear midpoint break occurs with FVG AND 15min MSS present | THEN structure supports entry | N/A |
| S-005 | IF opposite side FVG or order block is broken | THEN extend it to other side | N/A |
| S-006 | IF opposite side strong FVG is still open | THEN setup is invalidated (no entry) | N/A |
| S-007 | IF 5min clear order flow has started (already made LH or HL) AND 5min order block is present AND 15min momentum is there | THEN use 5min order block or BPR/IFVG to size position | N/A |
| S-008 | IF 5min EMA is broken | THEN adds extra confluence to entry | N/A |
| S-009 | IF all 5min scalp conditions are met | THEN place limit order at OTE just under 0.62 fib extension | N/A |
| S-010 | IF BPR is broken within the midpoint | THEN adds confluence to entry | N/A |
| S-011 | IF 15min EMA is broken | THEN adds confluence to entry | N/A |
| S-012 | IF taking 5min liquidity scalp | THEN does not need strong high or low formed before liquidity run - price usually takes liquidity and makes strong structure there | N/A |
| S-013 | IF taking 5min liquidity scalp | THEN does not need to be with the trend - usually a pullback trade where price takes opposite way liquidity | N/A |
| S-014 | IF taking 5min liquidity scalp | THEN 1hr is irrelevant, only need 15min momentum | N/A |
| S-017 | IF IOFED occurs on 15min AND no 5min entry presents | THEN note rejection and break down pattern | N/A |
