### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF daily trend direction is established AND price is in premium/discount zone AND LTF MMXM aligns with HTF | THEN look for 15min momentum breakout setup in direction of daily trend | N/A |
| S-002 | IF classic BUY/SELL sweep occurs in London killzone into PDA (1hr/4hr FVG/IFVG or OB) AND 15min MSS forms with bullish/bearish imbalance on 15min/10min/5min | THEN valid entry signal for momentum breakout | N/A |
| S-003 | IF BPR is present in sweep structure | THEN adds confluence to entry signal (extra plus) | N/A |
| S-004 | IF SMT divergence is present | THEN significantly increases setup quality (big plus) | N/A |
| S-005 | IF classic BUY day occurs | THEN price usually closes at or above daily open and NY open | N/A |
| S-006 | IF classic SELL day occurs | THEN price usually closes at or below daily open and NY open | N/A |
| S-007 | IF price is very close to main HTF target AND liquidity sweep into PDA occurs AND isolation strong low/high is clear AND 15min MSS with clear momentum (check 5min/2min) with BPR/IFVG present in sweep | THEN discretionary entry in premium zone is acceptable | N/A |
| S-008 | IF 15min MSS candle closes | THEN optimal entry point E1 is triggered | N/A |
| S-009 | IF standard entry is taken | THEN place stop loss above/below the low of 15min MSS candle | N/A |
| S-010 | IF price is close to main HTF target AND need tighter stop for sufficient RR | THEN place stop loss under/above 5min/2min BPR after liquidity sweep | N/A |
| S-011 | IF price breaks new 15min high/low OR trade is over 1% in profit | THEN move stop loss to breakeven (entry price) | N/A |
| S-012 | IF structural low/high is very close AND trading with main direction | THEN consider only taking partial risk off OR leaving stop loss alone to avoid stop out on second retest | N/A |
| S-013 | IF RR is 2:1 AND previous high/low breaks OR 1% profit reached | THEN move stop loss to breakeven and let remaining position run | N/A |
| S-014 | IF RR is more than 2:1 AND previous high/low breaks OR 1% profit reached | THEN move stop loss to breakeven, then trail stop on 15min or 1hr swing low/high | N/A |
