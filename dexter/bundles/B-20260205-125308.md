### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF it retraces and | THEN you want to buy it as it does that and then capture the next leg higher and everything's reversed for when it's bearish we'd be looking for rallies in price and we look into sell those rallies with the | 9:50 |
| S-003 | IF the markets bearish we look for an impulse leg lower in price okay and | THEN we expect to see price retrace higher back into optimal trade entry and that's defined between 62 and 79 cent racial it can be anywhere in here now the problem is is I'm not | 14:50 |
| S-004 | IF we have that anticipate some measure of buying and | THEN wait for the intermediate or high to be broken here you're gonna lose all this there's nothing wrong with that but if you want high probability and you want confirmation and I'm holding my fingers | 40:39 |
| S-005 | IF you're bullish you're gonna be buying the dips or any retracement slower after a price leg higher and | THEN the expectation is you're buying it when it retraces and then you want to buy it as it does that and then capture the next leg higher and everything's | 9:43 |
| S-008 | IF we get to 162 extension up here I would be another portion for me to take profits and | THEN if I'm extremely bullish I'll leave a small piece on for a measured move type effect so the same thing as seen over here for when the markets | 14:30 |
| S-009 | IF when it's supposed to be done and all that but ultimately we would expect to see it | THEN move down into some reasonable objective first profit would be down here but just above the old low so we would on take profit here the thing is | 16:35 |
| S-010 | IF I hear folks saying it's stupid to take first profit or scaling out profits because your initial risk is X and | THEN you've taken a small profit yada yada ya well that's because I'm looking for these objectives down here and it takes care of itself okay and it ends up | 19:39 |
| S-011 | IF it starts to rally like this they Jam their stop-loss right on | THEN and then it's this low here and then look at it does eventually comes back hits it you have to give the price freedom to trade from where you're trying to get in at to your | 37:07 |
| S-015 | IF it goes above it at the 127 extension basically is what this is I'm gonna be looking to take something off there and if we get to 162 extension up here I would be another portion for me to take profits and | THEN if I'm extremely bullish I'll | 14:23 |
| S-016 | IF I'm extremely bullish I'll leave a small piece on for a measured move type effect so the same thing as seen over here for when the markets bearish we look for an impulse leg lower in price okay and | THEN we expect to see price retrace higher back into optimal | 14:41 |
| S-017 | IF I get that everything past that first scaling out takes care of itself and that's why it's I laugh when I hear folks saying it's stupid to take first profit or scaling out profits because your initial risk is X and | THEN you've taken a small profit yada yada ya | 19:30 |
