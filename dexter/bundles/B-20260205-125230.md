### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF it's bullish we create the low of the day and | THEN it expands throughout the rest of the day now London open it can create obviously as I teach with power three it can create the low or high the day in this example here you can see the London | 1:25 |
| S-002 | IF it was London getting a high today it trades lower during the London session | THEN retraces pop into New York session creating a retracement which is a classic continuation on the bearish idea or down close premise for a daily range or your particular market | 4:13 |
| S-003 | IF we want to trade the New York open so the swing point takes place here we'd have to assume that were bullish before and | THEN the low has to be formed and shares a clear impulse swing during the London session then retraces during the loving lunch going into New York | 3:43 |
