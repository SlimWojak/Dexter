| S-003 | IF it gets back about five thousand | THEN I can start jumping I'll go up to the next unit leverage which is doubling to 25k to 50k so now it's five dollars per pip I'm risking if this is a winning trade I can start | 20:44 |
| S-004 | IF the trader takes a loss it drops down to its lowest leverage unit which is 5 K | THEN 5 K drops down to 10 I'm sorry moves up to 10 K after a win then another loss comes and then drops down the 5k and stays there for every loss when it makes money but we're below the | 31:04 |

| S-009 | IF I take a win on this trade my next trade does not go to percent of this equity balance it drops back down to 25 K and | THEN this is what it's meant to do and eventually you're gonna get a losing trade and now you don't have as much leverage on there and | 21:22 |
| S-010 | IF you're trying to avoid that you're actually hurting and stunting your growth as a developing trader so you want to be able to experience that phenomenon of being convinced almost that your trades gonna work out but | THEN see it not come to fruition and then | 7:09 |
