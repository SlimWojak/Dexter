### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF weekly candle shows initial bias for expansion higher or lower | THEN set initial bias for the week based on weekly candle direction | 979s |
| S-002 | IF daily chart shows swing highs and swing lows | THEN identify liquidity and draw on liquidity for trading decisions | 979s |
| S-003 | IF price creates a single candle pass higher with no overlap from previous or next candle | THEN identify it as an imbalance (FVG) | 979s |

| S-005 | IF market trades down and takes out sell stops during consolidation | THEN interpret this as inducing shorts and engineering liquidity | 1278s |
| S-006 | IF price sweeps sell stops below a short-term low during consolidation | THEN expect a run against short traders and a move toward buy stop liquidity | 1221s |
| S-007 | IF price sweeps buy stops above a short-term high during consolidation | THEN expect a significant price move lower | 1221s |
| S-008 | IF price sweeps sell stops below a short-term low | THEN expect a pronounced rally higher | 1221s |
| S-009 | IF price creates relative equal highs during consolidation | THEN expect a hunt of buy stop liquidity before a significant price move lower | 1221s |
| S-010 | IF price breaks below short-term low after running buy stops above equal highs | THEN look for break in market structure as confirmation for short entry | 1462s |
| S-011 | IF weekly chart shows bearish momentum with consolidation | THEN expect downside expansion after liquidity sweep of equal highs | 1508s |
| S-012 | IF price runs buy stops above equal highs in downtrend | THEN watch for short-term low formation followed by breakdown | 1520s |
| S-013 | IF break of market structure occurs on higher timeframe | THEN drop to 1-3 minute charts to find FVG imbalances | 1550s |
| S-014 | IF price breaks below a short-term low, creating a MSS | THEN look for FVG formation and sell into the imbalance | 1705s |
| S-015 | IF price enters FVG area after MSS | THEN sell short with stop above the high of the FVG candle | 1705s |
| S-016 | IF FVG setup is not clear on higher time frame | THEN scale down to lower time frame to identify FVG | 1705s |
| S-017 | IF price forms a fair value gap (FVG) in premium market (above 50% Fib of daily range) | THEN expect algorithms to drive price lower toward discount (below 50% Fib) | 1947s |
| S-018 | IF market opens and immediately runs up into a prior high | THEN sell short with stop above the high or candle's high | 1947s |
| S-019 | IF entry pattern forms and price starts moving lower without taking out prior low | THEN can still enter short near original entry area | 1947s |
| S-020 | IF price takes out prior low after entry pattern forms | THEN avoid chasing with market orders (risk of slippage) | 1947s |
| S-021 | IF price breaks below a short-term swing low during NY killzone (8:30-11:00 local time) | THEN look for FVG formation and enter short on retest | 2430s |
| S-022 | IF price runs buy stops (liquidity) then breaks market structure lower | THEN consider short entry with stop above recent candle high | 2580s |
| S-023 | IF price runs above an old high and breaks market structure on lower time frame | THEN look for imbalance (FVG) as trigger for short entry | 2671s |
| S-024 | IF short entry triggered after MSS and FVG formation | THEN split the range to find 50% level and target nearest old low/imbalance | 2671s |
| S-025 | IF weekly range expectation is lower prices | THEN focus on runs above old highs to identify liquidity pools | 2671s |
