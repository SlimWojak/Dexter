| S-002 | IF we're bullish in London we would expect to see New York continuing continue moving foolishly as well and | THEN London close be the high today if we're bearish and we've seen London bearish then New York bearish we're really looking for London | 6:02 |
| S-003 | IF we have a Z day where it goes up and down in quiet consolidation or a seek and destroy day which is a really wild choppy up-and-down day where it doesn't really go anywhere until the last portion of the day and | THEN it runs out the stops and no one saw coming so | 8:08 |
