### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF price is near HTF main target AND all other puzzle pieces are present | THEN only quick retest of closest OB is needed (does not need to be a strong one) | 01/07 |
| S-002 | IF 15min model is not very clear BUT all other pieces are there | THEN trade can still be valid for NY reversal setup | 23/07 |
| S-003 | IF price is very close to target AND 15min is not perfect BUT FVG formed in London killzone that was respected AND turned into BPR AND price broke out of it | THEN setup is valid despite imperfect 15min structure | 22/07 |
| S-004 | IF price is very near HTF OB main target | THEN only quick rejection of nearest 1hr discount PDAs needed for long entry | 16/09 |
| S-005 | IF 4hr shows bullish breakout BUT 1hr is not ready yet | THEN wait for 1hr confirmation before entry | 11/06 |
| S-006 | IF taking long position in premium zone AND close to HTF level | THEN setup is classified as A+ when all timeframe alignment present | 28/08 |
