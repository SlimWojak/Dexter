### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF we're bullish we're going to be looking at the open price and | THEN drop down buying anywhere between the opening price or just a little bit above it's still okay but mainly looking for a move below the opening price that's what we're looking for power three bullish | 6:01 |
| S-002 | IF we're bearish we're looking for the opening price and | THEN a move up to sell or fade that rally and then ride it lower for a down close now that's assuming that we know there's going to be a large range day or a directional bias that lends well to this | 6:14 |
| S-003 | IF this was the uh body of say for instance a Tuesday and | THEN say Wednesday we had this type of body we have a smaller bodied candle which means that we could see a large rains day on Thursday or Friday it's a it's more or less a uh a precursor if you will | 7:08 |
| S-004 | IF they're not paying attention to it it takes off and | THEN everybody else in the retail world will chase it once it's expanding I want to be in before the Big Move happens because I'm most likely going to be in while it's expanding up | 14:54 |
| S-005 | IF we're using power three if we're bullish we're going to be looking at the open price and | THEN drop down buying anywhere between the opening price or just a little bit above it's still okay but mainly looking for a move below the opening price that's what | 5:59 |
| S-006 | IF this is a bullish candle if this was the uh body of say for instance a Tuesday and | THEN say Wednesday we had this type of body we have a smaller bodied candle which means that we could see a large rains day on | 7:06 |
| S-007 | IF things are getting quiet that means the the Traders are going to get bored with it and when they're not paying attention to it it takes off and | THEN everybody else in the retail world will chase it once it's expanding I want to be in before the Big | 14:51 |
| S-008 | IF we use the Open high low and Clos bar okay this is a graphic depiction it's very easy to see at least for me it is when we're using power three if we're bullish we're going to be looking at the open price and | THEN drop down buying anywhere between the opening | 5:51 |
| S-009 | IF you will and what I do is I look for when things are getting quiet that means the the Traders are going to get bored with it and when they're not paying attention to it it takes off and | THEN everybody else in the retail world will chase it once it's | 14:49 |
