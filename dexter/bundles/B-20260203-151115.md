| S-001 | IF price runs above relative equal highs to engage buy-side liquidity | THEN expect price to reverse and move lower to take sell-side liquidity | 502s |
| S-002 | IF price moves lower after engaging buy-side liquidity | THEN expect price to trade back below the previous rally low | 502s |
| S-003 | IF price rallies to take buy-side liquidity | THEN expect price to reverse and take sell-side liquidity from trapped longs | 502s |
| S-004 | IF price forms a fair value gap (FVG) with a down closed candle | THEN expect price to trade back up to fill the FVG | 743s |
| S-005 | IF price rallies to relative equal highs | THEN expect price to engage buy stops or fill inefficiencies | 743s |

| S-008 | IF price retraces after a market structure shift above a high | THEN anticipate price reaching for the high again | 984s |
| S-009 | IF price sweeps buy-side liquidity highs that are relatively equal | THEN look for inefficiency above those highs to determine how far price can go | 984s |
| S-010 | IF price sweeps liquidity below equal lows | THEN look for retracement back below that low | 1226s |
| S-011 | IF price consolidates sideways after retracing into FVG with order block | THEN anticipate accumulation of long positions | 1226s |
| S-012 | IF price forms a balanced price range with overlapping sell-side and buy-side delivery | THEN identify trapped traders within that range | 1525s |
| S-013 | IF price leaves original consolidation and returns to it | THEN usually a trade (long or short depending on context) | 1710s |
| S-014 | IF price trades into 60-minute FVG with opposing candle bodies | THEN expect rejection (no continuation higher) | 2010s |
| S-015 | IF price drops aggressively below original consolidation to equal lows | THEN expect liquidity draw below (sell-side target) | 2010s |
| S-016 | IF price trades into a 60-minute FVG and candlestick bodies remain inside the FVG | THEN it indicates lack of interest to go higher, suggesting potential reversal | 1952s |
| S-017 | IF price drops below original consolidation and reaches relative equal lows | THEN expect sell-side liquidity to be resting below, drawing price lower | 1952s |
| S-018 | IF price forms an inversion FVG inside original consolidation | THEN expect price to go above it first, then use it as discount array for long entry | 2252s |
| S-019 | IF price forms bullish breaker (low high + lower low + down close) inside breaker candle | THEN it becomes a bullish order block for potential long entry | 2252s |
| S-020 | IF price forms a bullish order block after a down close candle inside a bullish breaker | THEN target the liquidity above the high of the older high to the left | 2193s |
| S-021 | IF price rallies up and trades back down into the bullish order block | THEN this is a first stage accumulation or second stage reaccumulation entry | 2193s |
| S-022 | IF price does not return to the original consolidation | THEN the bullish order block becomes the first stage accumulation entry | 2193s |
| S-023 | IF price forms a second stage redistribution in a sell model | THEN this is a unicorn setup favoring a short trade | 2492s |
| S-024 | IF price rallies up to the 60-minute FVG level | THEN go short and pyramid into the position | 2434s |
| S-025 | IF price is in a bearish market and exhibits predictable characteristics | THEN trade the tops using smart money reversals | 2632s |
| S-026 | IF price mohawks above the 60-minute FVG and then rallies back up | THEN look for consequent encroachment as a low-risk short entry | 2732s |
| S-027 | IF price trades into a bearish order block and digs into half of the body | THEN this is the second stage redistribution and fastest elevator ride down | 2916s |
| S-028 | IF a down close candle acts as a bullish order block on the buy side of the curve | THEN when price drops back into it, it should offer support | 2916s |
| S-029 | IF price is on the right side of the curve (sell side) and encounters previous support levels | THEN those levels should act as resistance | 2916s |
| S-030 | IF price trades back up to the butt end of a bullish order block body on the sell side of the curve | THEN this is the second stage redistribution and pyramiding short entry | 2916s |
| S-031 | IF price rallies into New York open Kill Zone with a breaker and bearish order block | THEN look for short entry using M 2022 model with FVG | 3158s |
