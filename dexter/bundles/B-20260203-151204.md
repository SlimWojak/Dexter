### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF price forms a down candle before a move higher (bullish order block) on daily chart | THEN look for price to return to that down candle's body for long entry with high probability of 20+ pip swing | 989s |
| S-002 | IF price breaks below old lows (turtle soup conditions) and hits a daily order block level | THEN expect potential reversal higher with confirmation | 1080s |
| S-003 | IF price trades through a bullish order block candle on lower timeframe | THEN enter long at opening price + spread of candle with high of candle as confirmation | 1200s |
| S-004 | IF equal highs exist above current price | THEN map buy stops above those levels as potential profit targets | 1120s |
| S-005 | IF price trades through a bullish order block on the daily chart | THEN enter long at the opening price of that candle plus spread | 1230s |
| S-006 | IF price drops below the midpoint of a bullish order block after entry | THEN exit the trade as it invalidates the setup | 1230s |
| S-007 | IF price reaches first profit objective (1:1 risk-reward) | THEN consider closing the trade or scaling out partially | 1230s |
| S-008 | IF price reaches second profit objective (multiple of two) | THEN move stop to breakeven and scale out further | 1230s |
| S-009 | IF price clears buy stops at equal highs | THEN expect further expansion toward higher liquidity areas | 1230s |
