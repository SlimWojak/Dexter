### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF price sweeps liquidity below relative equal lows | THEN expect displacement and potential trade above short-term high | 2924s |
| S-002 | IF price creates displacement after sweeping liquidity | THEN identify the down close candle as an order block | 2924s |
| S-003 | IF price sweeps liquidity and creates displacement against pre-session direction during London killzone (8:30) | THEN look for order block formation post-displacement for directional bias | 3167s |
| S-004 | IF market shows one-directional movement without retracements during killzone | THEN avoid chasing trades as this indicates potential manual intervention (news events) | 3302s |
| S-005 | IF analyzing 15m/5m/1m charts before London killzone (8:00-8:30) | THEN focus exclusively on highs/lows and inefficiencies on these timeframes for setup identification | 3405s |
| S-006 | IF you have a higher time frame premise and the directional draw where the Market's going to go | THEN you can determine if it's a breaker or a shift in Market structure | 4867s - 5163s |
| S-007 | IF the market creates a short-term inefficiency (FVG) and trades above it | THEN look for it to act as support (inversion FVG) | 4867s - 5163s |
| S-008 | IF price wicks above an inefficiency (FVG) but bodies stop inside it | THEN liquidity is likely below the wick | 4867s - 5163s |
| S-009 | IF price has relative equal highs or relative equal lows before a range | THEN bias is toward the side with the equal highs or lows | 6797s |
| S-010 | IF both relative equal highs and lows exist | THEN wait for the first one to get disrupted to determine bias | 6797s |
| S-011 | IF price shows jagged edges followed by a rip higher | THEN look for buy side liquidity (buy stops) as a trap | 7096s |
| S-012 | IF price trades down to a bullish breaker identified earlier | THEN expect price to go to the relative equal highs | 7096s |
| S-013 | IF price trades down to a bullish breaker and then goes to relative equal highs | THEN look for price to trade above the relative equal highs | 7038s |
| S-014 | IF price trades up to a fair value gap (FVG) near equilibrium | THEN watch for price to take off and run toward expected delivery areas | 7337s |
| S-015 | IF price reaches smooth (still water) areas where stops are likely clustered | THEN expect sharks (institutional traders) to attack these levels | 7337s |
| S-016 | IF price forms smooth relative equal highs at 7:00 to 7:30, 8:00 to 8:30, or 9:00 to 9:30 during London killzone | THEN expect price to target those levels with increasing likelihood as each time window passes | 7577s |
| S-017 | IF price does not take out relative equal highs during 7:00 to 7:30 or 8:00 to 8:30 | THEN expect increased likelihood of targeting those levels during 9:00 to 9:30 | 7577s |
| S-018 | IF price creates jagged swings downward | THEN recognize that liquidity has been attacked in that area | 7279s |
| S-019 | IF price forms relative equal highs at 7:00 AM | THEN look for a run on liquidity during the 9:00-9:30 AM window | 7520s |
| S-020 | IF price forms two extremes above and below the dealing range | THEN wait for one of them to be disrupted | 7819s |
