### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF price sweeps liquidity below equal lows during London killzone (LOKZ) | THEN look for displacement and FVG formation for long entry | N/A |
| S-002 | IF Daily direction is clear and 60min TF is not against your anticipated direction | THEN it's a green light to look for entries on 15/5/2min TFs | N/A |
| S-003 | IF 60min retracement is too sharp/aggressive against your bias | THEN wait for price to head into imbalance below before expanding higher | N/A |
| S-004 | IF price forms a clear strong low/high | THEN expect deeper retracement before next move | N/A |
| S-005 | IF price attacks low resistance BSLQ with higher timeframe momentum | THEN expect price to slice through aggressively | N/A |
| S-006 | IF Daily expansion moves occur (200+ pip moves) | THEN expect continuation in direction of expansion | N/A |
| S-007 | IF price forms a high resistance low with higher TF bearish momentum | THEN expect more difficulty breaking through and more choppy price action | N/A |
| S-008 | IF trading during London Close Killzone (profit taking time) | THEN expect majority of profits to be taken with possible continuation to extreme targets | N/A |
