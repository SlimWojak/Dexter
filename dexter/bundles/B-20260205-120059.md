### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF HTF is in premium/discount AND 4HR takes out previous high/low into PDAs AND 5MIN/2MIN forms BPR/FVG/IFVG on the liquidity run AND the new low does not take any opposite side liquidity AND price is near NY Open/Daily Open | THEN valid 15MIN OTE setup for entry | N/A |
| S-002 | IF 4HR takes out previous high/low AND displacement occurs with FVG formation | THEN breakdown is valid for continuation | N/A |
| S-003 | IF new high is taken on liquidity grab | THEN look for SMT divergence to form | N/A |
| S-004 | IF setting up 15MIN OTE | THEN check weekly opening price for reference | N/A |
| S-005 | IF liquidity grab occurs with SMT divergence present | THEN setup has additional confirmation for reversal | N/A |
| S-006 | IF 1HR is not ready yet BUT clear 15MIN MMSM exists AND no strong FVG on the way down | THEN 15MIN setup can be considered despite 1HR not being aligned | N/A |
| S-007 | IF price retraces to demand zone AND 50% retracement level is reached AND BOS has occurred AND all timeframes align | THEN take profit targets are valid | N/A |
