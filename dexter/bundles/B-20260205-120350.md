### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF price on parent TF (e.g., 60m) is in expansion run AND price reaches second half or last quadrant of the MMXM range | THEN expect one-sided orderflow on execution TF (2/5min) where price rejects every FVG/OB it leaves behind without giving complex structures or traps | N/A |
| S-002 | IF price is in beginning phases before expansion OR around equilibrium (EQ) | THEN expect price to give mess, traps, and complex structures | N/A |
| S-003 | IF price reaches clear parent TF level/PDA target from execution TF POV | THEN treat as hitting objective complete (OC) in MMXM - enter no man's land where complex stop running structure likely forms before reversal or bear-trap | N/A |
| S-004 | IF clear target visible on parent TF AND space remains between current price and target | THEN valid to take quick scalp targeting that level, then step aside once target is hit | N/A |
| S-005 | IF hourly TF shows IOFED (Institutional Order Flow Expansion Day) type development | THEN avoid trying to go against it | N/A |
| S-006 | IF identifying dealing range in bearish context | THEN mark up last strong high (created by sweep of liquidity before expansion into new low) to the low of that expansion | N/A |
| S-007 | IF monthly candle closes bullish leaving a wick below | THEN expect price to retrace back into that wick at least 30% before continuing up | N/A |
| S-008 | IF price grinding up with no strong momentum AND no FVGs forming | THEN indicates weak move lacking institutional participation | N/A |
