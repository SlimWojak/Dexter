| S-003 | IF price retraces into a daily FVG (imbalance between low and high) | THEN expect reaction at FVG boundaries | 75s |

| S-005 | IF price creates relative equal highs ahead of NY open (8:30-9:30) | THEN watch for sell-off into prior imbalance | 175s |
| S-006 | IF price trades back into prior imbalance after taking out equal highs | THEN imbalance becomes FVG entry candidate | 220s |
| S-007 | IF price sweeps relative equal highs after market open (9:30) | THEN expect retracement into prior imbalance for long entry | 248s |
| S-008 | IF price trades into a bullish order block (consecutive down-close candles) with displacement | THEN anticipate long entry at OTE (61.8-78.6% retracement) | 320s |
| S-009 | IF price forms FVG with order block at lows and tests OTE during killzone (8:30-9:30) | THEN validate long entry with multiple confirmations (liquidity sweep, OB hit, OTE) | 380s |
| S-010 | IF bullish bias with opening price at 8:30 and price trades below it | THEN look for long entry near opening price after short-term low is taken | 400s |

| S-012 | IF price is inside an order block, FVG, and retracement of the FVG | THEN expect a market run up into a higher retracement | 491s |
| S-013 | IF there is a big run up or down overnight | THEN wait for consolidation before entering | 790s |
| S-014 | IF there is a big overnight range movement | THEN do not expect a lot of in-and-out trades, wait for a significant price move | 790s |
| S-015 | IF there is a big run overnight in equities (NASDAQ, Dow, e-mini S&P) | THEN avoid the New York session and wait until after 1:00 PM New York time | 733s |
| S-016 | IF price drops below the New York session low | THEN anticipate a draw on liquidity into the fair value gap | 733s |
| S-017 | IF price respects the fair value gap boundary | THEN expect algorithmic precision in price action | 733s |
| S-018 | IF price sweeps sell-side liquidity below relative equal lows in the afternoon session | THEN expect a rally into the imbalance | 974s |
| S-019 | IF price trades down into an imbalance after New York lunch | THEN expect price to rally rather than continue through the imbalance | 974s |
| S-020 | IF price breaks a swing high with energetic displacement and forms a fair value gap | THEN look for a short-term low to form as a buying opportunity | 974s |
| S-021 | IF price breaks a swing high with energy and creates a fair value gap (FVG) | THEN look for a short-term low to form as potential long entry | 1214s |
| S-022 | IF sell-side liquidity rests below a short-term low after FVG forms | THEN use the low (or minus one tick) as entry point with stop below the short-term low | 1250s |
| S-023 | IF overnight price shows strong directional run-up | THEN avoid morning session trades (chasing likely leads to losses) | 1400s |
| S-024 | IF price breaks a swing high and forms a fair value gap (FVG) | THEN consider entering a trade with the FVG as the basis for entry | 1457s |
| S-025 | IF price trades below a short-term low where sell stops are located | THEN monitor for potential stop runs before reversal | 1457s |
| S-026 | IF price respects the body of a candle forming an FVG despite volatility | THEN permit imperfection in price delivery and maintain FVG-based entry | 1457s |
| S-027 | IF price trades into an imbalance and then hits an order block | THEN look for buy entry at the order block | 1668s |
