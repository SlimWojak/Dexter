### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF that trades through | THEN we'd be looking for an area in here we're all these overlaps starts to take place I'm going to take all of the horizontal lines off to make a little bit cleaner and we can see that the lowest point at | 9:27 |
| S-002 | IF we did when we scrubbed over to the left side of the chart and we drew those horizontal lines across we have one target here and | THEN another target here but look what happens right in the middle of that we have this level here | 4:29 |
| S-003 | IF we scrubbed over to the left side of the chart and we drew those horizontal lines across we have one target here and | THEN another target here but look what happens right in the middle of that we have this level here to target to lies directly right in the | 4:31 |
| S-004 | IF you won 1898 you can go to more pips just with just a spread or chaotic price action would take us right up into that 119 big figure if that trades through | THEN we'd be looking for an area in here we're all these overlaps starts to take place | 9:19 |
| S-006 | IF I'm doing this I look for just the levels and I can start keeping an eye on where they're starting the group now once we have an area where they start to converge here and | THEN over here right away we're below that price level as we're coming up so this | 8:59 |
| S-007 | IF this is gonna be replicated and we get that same measurement to measure move idea from this high to this low using the bodies this is the bulk of the volume and | THEN projecting it down again would take us right to here so we have | 14:56 |
