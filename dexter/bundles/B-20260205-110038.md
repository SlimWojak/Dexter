### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF clear liquidity draw to target exists (usually Asia highs/lows) AND price did not take opposite side liquidity AND small 5min MMM is visible AND clear liquidity run occurred within MMM | THEN 5min liquidity scalp setup is valid | N/A |
| S-002 | IF liquidity is taken with IFVG formation during the run | THEN this adds confluence to the 5min scalp setup | N/A |
| S-004 | IF midpoint breaks with FVG AND 15min MSS occurs AND opposite side FVG/order block is broken | THEN extend the broken structure to the other side for reference | N/A |
| S-005 | IF opposite side strong FVG is still open | THEN setup is invalidated (no trade) | N/A |
| S-006 | IF 5min clear order flow has started (LH or HL already formed) AND 5min order block exists AND 15min momentum is present | THEN use the 5min order block or BPR/IFVG to size position | N/A |
| S-007 | IF 5min EMA is broken | THEN this provides extra confluence for the setup | N/A |
| S-008 | IF all checklist conditions are met | THEN enter with limit order at OTE just under 0.62 fib extension | N/A |
| S-009 | IF BPR is broken within the midpoint | THEN this adds confluence to the entry | N/A |
| S-010 | IF 15min EMA is broken | THEN this adds confluence to the entry | N/A |
| S-011 | IF no strong high or low formed before the liquidity run | THEN setup is still valid because price usually takes that liquidity and makes strong structure there | N/A |
| S-012 | IF trade is counter to the trend (pullback trade taking opposite side liquidity) | THEN setup is still valid | N/A |
| S-013 | IF trading 5min liquidity scalps | THEN 1hr timeframe is irrelevant; only 15min momentum is needed | N/A |
| S-014 | IF midpoint level is identified | THEN it usually aligns with 15min MSS low/high | N/A |
| S-015 | IF entry is taken after RT (not during) | THEN the high/low should have been created during RT | N/A |
