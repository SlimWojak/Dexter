### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF price pulls back to W FVG (high resistance) and gets rejected | THEN focus on 4H dealing range and look for continuation of rejection | N/A - chart annotation |
| S-002 | IF price rejects at W FVG resistance | THEN target lows to BSL or PDWL | N/A - chart annotation |
| S-003 | IF D FVG is acting bearish AND W FVG is present above | THEN high probability move is to the long side | N/A - chart annotation |
| S-004 | IF price breaks the D FVG AND takes the PDL | THEN D1 highs can see a price reaction AND D1 FVG is likely to be filled after | N/A - chart annotation |
| S-005 | IF large bullish expansion phase occurs AND price reaches W FVG AND multiple levels of confluence exist | THEN aggressive sells make sense below the PDH | N/A - chart annotation |
| S-006 | IF liquidity is present | THEN price moves to either: liquidity → liquidity, liquidity → imbalance, or imbalance → liquidity | N/A - chart annotation |
