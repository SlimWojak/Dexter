### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF the first FVG forms inside the session | THEN treat it as important - it will often act as a breakaway gap or an inverse gap that will be traded to later | unknown |
| S-002 | IF Daily direction order flow gets exhausted | THEN market maker small 5/15 min models start - go to 4hr time frame for levels | unknown |
| S-003 | IF uncertain which 15min FVG to use | THEN look at 1hr OB for guidance | unknown |
| S-004 | IF price is in the last stages of MMM (market maker model) | THEN pull back will be quick and to the nearest order block | unknown |
| S-005 | IF there is a BPR (balanced price range) above or below an order block | THEN price is likely NOT to return to that OB | unknown |
| S-006 | IF price enters external liquidity on the higher TF and hits our targets | THEN focus goes to the lower TF opposite liquidity levels (20day range, most focus on last 5day range) | unknown |
| S-007 | IF FVG forms inside of the kill zone at specific time | THEN that FVG is highest probability | unknown |
| S-008 | IF evaluating 4hr FVG strength | THEN check if it formed during key times and if 1hr already filled this FVG | unknown |
| S-009 | IF price sits on a weekly opening AND does not take liquidity AND starts sharply moving away from it with nice lows/highs and FVGs | THEN enter the trade | unknown |
| S-010 | IF strong protraction occurs AND runs liquidity (ideally into opposing PDAs during killzone) AND leaves sharp/strong structure AND ETFs shift into clear order flow | THEN this is Option A entry setup | unknown |
| S-011 | IF price gives strong isolation AND strong 31st L type of structure AND current price action cannot be trusted AND occurs during killzone | THEN this is Option B entry setup | unknown |
| S-012 | IF order flow continues on LTF to the point where it wouldn't make sense for LTFs to drop all the way running liquidity that's already far away | THEN this is Option C entry setup - look for continuation | unknown |
