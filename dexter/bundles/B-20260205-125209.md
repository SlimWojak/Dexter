### IF-THEN SIGNATURES
| ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) | Source Timestamp |
|----|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| S-001 | IF we're bullish it's going to go below that opening price to seek liquidity and | THEN go higher and spend the rest of the day going higher when it's bearish it'll go above the opening price at midnight to reach for liquidity and then move lower for several hours going into | 19:02 |
| S-002 | IF that stock gets filled if it happens | THEN we would place a sell stop below this low at some specific price level and you could leave that in the marketplace and go to sleep and don't even worry about watching all this stuff okay that's one way you can | 22:22 |
| S-003 | IF we're bullish we'd like to see this element here and | THEN this here no problem we don't need to get that and we don't need to be a part of this movie or okay we wouldn't wait for price to come back down and touch the Asian range high now it does so here | 23:16 |
| S-004 | IF you look for specific times of the day and specific generic concepts or characteristics that should manifest themselves | THEN there's a storyline that will start to develop and you get this over the years many times it's referred to as tapereading | 13:05 |
| S-005 | IF you put your pole position down here and you're risking 2% well I wasn't risking 2% so I'm trading at 1% 1/2 percent and | THEN this position here if it fills me I'm not over leverage or if I do get one half percent on here and this half here | 17:30 |
| S-006 | IF basically if you if you want to think of it like that so if we're bullish it's going to go below that opening price to seek liquidity and | THEN go higher and spend the rest of the day going higher when it's bearish it'll go above the opening price at midnight | 18:58 |
| S-007 | IF you want to think of it like that so if we're bullish it's going to go below that opening price to seek liquidity and | THEN go higher and spend the rest of the day going higher when it's bearish it'll go above the opening price at midnight to reach for liquidity and then move | 19:00 |
| S-008 | IF it's bearish it'll go above the opening price at midnight to reach for liquidity and | THEN move lower for several hours going into London closed or New York open so let's take a look at what's going on with the implementation of the agent | 19:11 |
| S-009 | IF we have a parent contingent order suggesting they who buy on a stop if that stock gets filled if it happens | THEN we would place a sell stop below this low at some specific price level and you could leave that in the marketplace and go to sleep | 22:16 |
| S-010 | IF HIPAA the interbank price delivery algorithm resets and | THEN it it attacks open liquidity or the open flow which would be the order table of the agent range and below the agent range all right you know you're gonna know 15 | 23:52 |
| S-011 | IF you will on price action so what we're going to doing is waiting for a break in the Asian range low and | THEN when price trades back up to it we're going to be anticipating institutional selling so let's take a closer look at this example here | 26:18 |
| S-012 | IF this order fails it will place a protective buy stop above the high + 3 pips and | THEN again same scenario I would take profit of 50 tips which is a low and I make weekly objective and that's it I don't trail my stop | 32:32 |
| S-013 | IF that happens we could sell short there or the low risk confirmation trade is wait for the Asian range low the break and | THEN trade back up to it and then we can sell there okay and if it happens to occur during an ICT kill zone London open or | 35:02 |
| S-014 | IF it happens to occur during an ICT kill zone London open or New York open their probabilities go through the roof in terms of being well accurate and | THEN you can see that unfolding your charts if you go through the the charts with this in mind okay | 35:14 |
| S-015 | IF you can get just 65 to 70 percent accuracy with or with your bias and | THEN wait for conditions like I'm showing you here adding time of day kill zones daily bias focusing was the Asian range we've already looked at | 38:06 |
| S-016 | IF I either did not have the guts to do that or I missed the opportunity sometimes I would wait for a specific price it wouldn't get there and | THEN it would take off if I saw a reversal or potential reversal I would look at the | 15:25 |
| S-017 | IF I didn't get filled down here below the opening price at midnight this would be where my buy stop with filming and my stop loss would be below the low and you can see I had to weather this retracement here and | THEN because he gets the move later on in the day now | 18:13 |
| S-018 | IF I'm filled with your broker for cancer order basically if we have a parent contingent order suggesting they who buy on a stop if that stock gets filled if it happens | THEN we would place a sell stop below this low at some specific price level and you could leave | 22:14 |
| S-019 | IF it's in a tight narrow consolidation we're gonna be looking for some measure of manipulation if you will on price action so what we're going to doing is waiting for a break in the Asian range low and | THEN when price trades back up to it | 26:12 |
