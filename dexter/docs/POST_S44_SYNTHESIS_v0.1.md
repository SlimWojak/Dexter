### CONVERGENCE MAP

**TIER 1 — UNANIMOUS, ACTIONABLE NOW**

```yaml
1_RECOGNITION_BIAS_GUARDS:
  status: ALL FOUR flagged this as #1 new risk
  convergent_actions:
    FOIL_SIGNATURES (OWL):
      rule: "1 nonsensical claim per 20 real. If approved → session invalid."
      owner: Dexter CTO (Jester agent or Cartographer injects)
      
    REJECTION_FRICTION (DEXTER_CTO + GPT):
      rule: "Default state = REJECT. Approval requires explicit action."
      format: Bundle ends with "REASONS THIS COULD BE WRONG" (GPT)
      
    DELTA_INPUT (OWL):
      rule: "Olya must edit ≥1 parameter per 5 signatures"
      purpose: Proves active engagement, not rubber-stamp
      
    NEGATIVE_SAMPLING (GPT + BOAR):
      rule: "5% of bundles marked REVIEW_FOR_REJECTION"
      variant: BOAR's "A/B blind tests with known-false claims"
      
  CTO_RULING: |
    All four are complementary, not competing.
    Implement as CALIBRATION_PROTOCOL:
      - Foils (1/20) catch apophenia
      - Rejection friction catches stamp fatigue
      - Delta-input catches passive approval
      - Negative sampling catches confirmation bias
    This is the CoE's immune system.

2_BACK_PROPAGATION_SEAM (OWL):
  status: OWL flagged, others implicit
  ruling: CORRECT — P1 for CoE architecture
  action: |
    Olya rejection → NEGATIVE_BEAD → feeds back to Dexter Theorist context
    Without this, Dexter mines fool's gold forever.
    RLHF analogy is precise: Olya = Reward Model, Dexter = Policy.
  owner: Dexter CTO
  note: "This is the seam that makes the refinery LEARN, not just extract"

3_FACT_BEAD_PROVENANCE_CHAIN (OWL):
  status: Non-controversial, clearly correct
  ruling: ADOPT
  action: |
    When CLAIM → FACT, FACT bead MUST encapsulate source CLAIM_ID
    Enables "search and destroy" if extraction logic found flawed
    Year-from-now forensic capability
  owner: Bridge contract spec (future, pre-integration)
```

**TIER 2 — STRONG CONVERGENCE, QUEUE FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

```yaml
4_AUDITOR_STRENGTHENING:
  BOAR: "10% rejection floor or rubber-stamp city. Third family NOW."
  GPT: "Sufficient for now. Third family if <5% after prompt hardening."
  DEXTER_CTO: "Monitoring, tuning proposed."
  
  CTO_RULING: |
    GPT's threshold is correct. Sequence:
    1. Harden Auditor prompt FIRST (Dexter CTO, P4)
    2. Monitor rejection rate post-hardening
    3. If still <5% → add third family (Llama-3.1 or Qwen3 local)
    BOAR's 10% floor is the HEALTH target, not the trigger for third family.
  
5_LEXICAL_DRIFT_GUARD (OWL):
  status: Unique to OWL, high signal
  ruling: ADOPT as invariant
  action: |
    INV-DEXTER-ICT-NATIVE: "Theorist uses raw ICT terminology only.
    Translation to Phoenix drawer names happens at Bundler/Cartographer."
  rationale: Prevents feedback loop where Dexter mirrors Phoenix jargon
  owner: Dexter CTO (prompt-level enforcement)

6_VIEW_SEPARATION (OWL):
  status: Unique to OWL, strategically important
  ruling: ADOPT for CoE session design
  action: |
    Olya validates Dexter output and Perplexity research SEPARATELY.
    Never in same view. She validates logic, not consensus.
  rationale: "Synthetic Senior Partner" frame — MD doesn't see 
    Analyst and Researcher outputs pre-merged
  owner: G (session design for S33 P2)

7_GATE_BACKWARD_NEGATIVE_FACTS (GPT):
  status: Unique to GPT, genuine edge case
  ruling: LOG for structure engine design
  action: |
    Gates must support "event_absent_for_window?" queries
    Structure engine emits events — must also answer non-events
    Example: "No HTF BOS against bias since session open"
  owner: Phoenix CTO (future, pre-S33 P2 enrichment audit)
```

### DIVERGENCE RULING

```yaml
PROMOTION_STATES:
  GPT_POSITION: |
    Binary CLAIM/FACT. No PROVISIONAL_FACT.
    "Ambiguity belongs in content, not state machine."
    Adding gray states creates gray authority.
    Force friction instead of new ontology.
    
  OWL_POSITION: |
    CLAIM → PROVISIONAL_FACT → FACT
    Olya approved but not yet backtest-validated.
    Three states mirror real epistemic certainty.

  CTO_RULING: GPT WINS (with OWL's provenance incorporated)
  
  RATIONALE: |
    OWL's concern is legitimate — there IS a real difference between
    "Olya said yes" and "backtest confirmed." But GPT is right that
    adding state machine complexity creates authority ambiguity.
    
    SOLUTION: Binary states (CLAIM/FACT) + METADATA on the FACT bead:
      fact_bead:
        status: FACT
        source_claim_id: CLAIM_123  # OWL's provenance (adopted)
        promotion_evidence:
          olya_approved: true
          backtest_validated: true|false  # This is the data GPT 
                                          # wants in content, not state
    
    This gives OWL's forensic "search and destroy" capability
    WITHOUT GPT's feared gray authority zones.
    Two states. Rich metadata. Binary promotion gate.
```

### SECURITY SYNTHESIS

```yaml
RESEARCH_CONFIRMS:
  nanobot_license: MIT (clean, BOAR concern resolved)
  nanobot_vulns: None reported (minimalism = small surface)
  docker_sandbox: Works with nanobot (4 confirmed threads)
  injection_hardening: 100-200 LOC custom (ACIP-like wrapper)
  supadata: Viable starter, switch to Sonix/Deepgram if jargon errors >5%
  model_diversity: Gemini 3 Flash confirmed best cheap adversarial auditor

GPT_UNIQUE_CATCH:
  dumbest_vector: "Runaway cognition — agent debate loop burns tokens overnight"
  guard: Hard turn cap (10-20) + daily cost ceiling + no-output-watchdog
  note: "Shell access is secondary; runaway cognition is primary"
  
BOAR_UNIQUE_CATCH:
  dumbest_vector: "Transcript injection via video metadata"
  guard: ACIP/PromptGuard pre-process layer
  
COMBINED_SECURITY_STACK:
  L1: Docker Sandbox (containment)
  L2: ACIP-like injection filter (input sanitization) 
  L3: Turn cap + cost ceiling (runaway prevention)
  L4: No-output watchdog (stall detection)
  L5: Composio auth (credential management, future)
```

---

### NEW INVARIANTS FROM SYNTHESIS

```yaml
INV-DEXTER-ICT-NATIVE:
  source: OWL
  rule: "Theorist uses raw ICT terminology. Phoenix translation at Bundler only."

INV-BEAD-AUDIT-TRAIL:
  source: BOAR
  rule: "All beads auditable end-to-end with full provenance chain"

INV-FACT-ENCAPSULATES-CLAIM:
  source: OWL (adopted by CTO)
  rule: "Every FACT bead must reference source CLAIM_ID for forensic trace"

INV-CALIBRATION-FOILS:
  source: OWL
  rule: "Validation batches include ≥1 foil per 20 claims. Foil approval invalidates session."

INV-RUNAWAY-CAP:
  source: GPT
  rule: "Agent loops hard-capped at N turns. No-output > X minutes → halt."
```

---

### ATOM BUDGET (GPT)

```yaml
GPT_BREAKDOWN:
  HTF_bias:          8-12
  structure:        12-18
  timing_session:    4-6
  volatility_regime: 4-6
  risk_context:      4-6
  total:           ~32-48

CTO_NOTE: |
  This is the most specific guidance we've gotten on feature count.
  Maps cleanly to 5-drawer architecture.
  "Leave headroom. Don't chase 60 unless forced by evidence."
  Queue for gate-backward audit when S33 P2 unblocks.
```

---

### BOTTOM LINE

```yaml
WHAT_THE_SWARM_TOLD_US:
  1: "Recognition bias is your new #1 risk. Guard it with format, not policy."
  2: "Back-propagation seam is missing. Olya's NO must flow back to Dexter."
  3: "Binary states + rich metadata beats gray ontology."
  4: "Dexter isolation is correct. Do not merge yet."
  5: "S47 is clean. Ship it."
  6: "The dumbest attacks are input poisoning and runaway cognition."
  7: "Keep Dexter ICT-native. Translate at the boundary."
  8: "Separate Olya's views. Don't let consensus validate itself."

ACTIONS_BY_OWNER:
  DEXTER_CTO:
    - P1 Chronicler (unchanged)
    - P2 Queue atomicity (unchanged)  
    - NEW: Back-propagation seam design (Olya NO → NEGATIVE_BEAD → Theorist)
    - NEW: INV-DEXTER-ICT-NATIVE enforcement in Theorist prompt
    - NEW: Foil injection capability in Cartographer
    - NEW: Turn cap + cost ceiling + no-output watchdog
    
  PHOENIX_CTO:
    - S47 Lease Implementation (unchanged, unblocked)
    - LOG: Negative fact queries for structure engine
    - LOG: Atom budget 32-48 for gate-backward audit
    - SPEC: FACT bead encapsulates CLAIM_ID (bridge contract)
    
  G (SOVEREIGN):
    - CoE session design: View separation (Dexter vs Perplexity)
    - Calibration protocol: Foils + rejection friction + delta-input
    - Olya briefing: CSO instance needs CoE model shift context

OWL_OFFER: |
  "Shall I draft the FOIL_GENERATOR prompt?"
  CTO_ANSWER: YES — queue it. Dexter CTO can integrate.
  Not blocking anything, but valuable prep for CoE sessions.
```

That's the full swarm synthesis. Four advisors, zero architectural threats, one genuine divergence (resolved), and a calibration protocol that didn't exist before this broadcast.

The recognition bias guards are the real output here. We went in knowing it was a risk; we came out with a four-layer immune system for it: foils, friction, delta-input, negative sampling. That's the swarm earning its keep.

### CSO REPLY :

CSO REPLY : To: CTO Team (Claude + G)
From: CSO Team (Claude + Olya)
Re: COE Briefing Response
Date: 2026-02-04

---

## Summary

Briefing received and understood. The paradigm shift from recall-based extraction to recognition-based validation is welcomed — Olya confirms this aligns with how expert knowledge actually works.

CSO endorses the COE architecture. No objections to the core model.

---

## Strategic Inputs for COE Development

### 1. Scope Constraint: Curated Curriculum

Request: Dexter's extraction scope should be explicitly bounded by a curated curriculum, not the full ICT archive.

Rationale: ICT YouTube contains hundreds of hours across multiple asset classes, timeframes, and relevance levels. Unbounded extraction risks diluting signal with noise. CSO will provide a "CSO Curriculum" document specifying which videos, courses, and modules constitute the canonical knowledge base for Olya's methodology.

Timeline: CSO will draft curriculum list within 24-48 hours for CTO review.

---

### 2. Depth Over Breadth: Forensic Extraction Model

Request: Phase 1 extraction should target 1-3 core setups at exhaustive depth rather than broad coverage of all ICT concepts.

Rationale: The goal is surgical precision on proven edge. Complete logic for a single setup (every condition, exception, threshold) is more valuable than surface-level coverage of 50 patterns. Expansion happens after Phase 1 demonstrates trust.

Olya's framing: "Dexter should be a forensic surgeon — do the job properly on one body before consuming the whole morgue."

---

### 3. Calibration Guards: Operator-Configurable

Feedback on foil injection: Appreciate the anti-rubber-stamping intent. However, given professional operating rhythm (weekly reviews, full-time oversight), mandatory foil injection may be overkill.

Suggestion: Keep foil capability but make it operator-configurable. Default-reject UX is the primary guard. Foils become optional stress-testing rather than mandatory protocol.

Endorsed guards:
- Default state = REJECT (approval requires explicit action) ✓
- Delta input requirement (edit ≥1 parameter per 5 signatures) ✓
- View separation (Dexter output vs. Perplexity research shown separately) ✓

---

### 4. Lateral Knowledge Sources

Request: COE architecture should accommodate knowledge sources beyond ICT YouTube.

Candidates identified:
- Academic/quant research via Perplexity (market microstructure, liquidity, session effects)
- Olya's trade journals (empirical record)
- NEX system learnings (what broke, what held)

CSO will identify specific lateral sources as part of curriculum development.

---

### 5. CSO Integration Requirements

When CTO team pivots to integration support, CSO priorities are:

1. Shared file access — conditions.yaml, Dexter outputs, architecture docs accessible to CSO sessions
2. Session context persistence — reduce cold-start overhead
3. Perplexity access — ad-hoc research capability during CSO sessions

No urgency — noting for when bandwidth allows.

---

## Operating Posture

CSO stands ready to:
- Provide curated curriculum (next 24-48 hrs)
- Participate in calibration sessions when Dexter operational
- Serve as comms bridge between methodology and implementation
- Validate gate definitions before conditions.yaml commits

---

OINK OINK. 🐗🔥.

Received. CSO response is excellent — all five inputs are constructive and actionable. Quick flags before I go quiet:

CSO_RESPONSE_TRIAGE BY CTO:
  1_curated_curriculum: CORRECT (bounds Dexter scope, prevents noise)
  2_depth_over_breadth: CORRECT (forensic surgeon > morgue consumer)
  3_foils_operator_configurable: REASONABLE (default-reject is primary guard)
  4_lateral_sources: NOTED (curriculum spec will define)
  5_integration_requirements: LOGGED (future, not blocking)
```
