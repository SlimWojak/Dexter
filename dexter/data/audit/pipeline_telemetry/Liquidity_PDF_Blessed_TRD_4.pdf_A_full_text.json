Because they (the \nInformed Money), will want to sell at a higher price, take the Liquidity and cover \ntheir long positions that they opened to run the price higher.\nSo, they aim at the Liquidity Pool (in this example BSLQ), they open long \npositions to push the price higher into the BS Liquidity Pool, then use that \nLiquidity to cover Long positions, and open Short positions at a higher price.\n\nHigh resistance Liquidity\nWhen we see market making higher highs & higher lows after already running the sell-\nside liquidity, we can\u2019t reasonably expect for price to drop all the way down below the \nmain low to take those stops out. There will be a lot of resistance like:\nBullish orderblocks (unless all of them are already very clearly mitigated and it\u2019s a \n\u201cTrendline Phantom in the making), then doesn\u2019t matter how much liquidity there is \nbelow these main lows.\nIt\u2019s a \u201chigh resistance liquidity run\u201d, so in other words, the more time price spent around \nthat area actually making clear, one-sided moves, running sell-side liquidity, etc., the \nmore unlikely that price will drop to the main old low despite the level of liquidity resting \nthere.\n\nLow resistance Liquidity\nWhat retail sees as a \u201cdouble bottom\u201d area as strong support, what we see is all \nthe sell stops resting below (retail stop losses) \u2013 that\u2019s our target and a magnet \nwhere the price will be drawn to.\nAll the double, triple tops & bottoms, consolidations that are slowly going lower \nor higher \u2013 that\u2019s our target, that\u2019s what we want to see. We\u2019re not going to trade \naway from these types of lows/highs, we\u2019re going to trade directly into it.\nLow resistance liquidity run is when aggressive acceleration happens leaving \nliquidity void \u2013 that\u2019s when everything that builds up to fill it is considered as low \nresistance until price reaches the opposing array\u2019s, so if a big drop happened, and \nprice starts building longs to fill it \u2013 it\u2019s a low resistance run until price reaches \nfirst bearish array like a bearish breaker, orderblock, and so on.\n\nRun on Liquidity before retracing\nWhen we know what the Higher TF orderflow is we wait for retracements \nto ride the direction towards the Higher TF draw on Liquidity. It\u2018s \nimportant to pay attention not only where the price pulls back but also \nwhat it does before pulling back, so there\u2018re two scenarios:\n1.\nPrice will run Liquidity, give a break of structure and then pull back\n2.\nOr after a strong expansion price will not run any Liquidity, and just \nslowly start to form (in this case) higher highs, higher lows\nSo, when price runs Liquidity before retracing \u2013 usually it will pull back \ndeeper + the retracement will take longer AND when price does not run \nLiquidity before retracing, that\u2018s when it\u2018s more likely that the pull back \nwon\u2018t last long, price will reach the first strong opposing level, and \nattack the Higher TF target + the low that price left before pulling back.\n\n# BLESSED TRADER\n*Your guide to consistency in the industry of loss.*\n\n---\n\n## LEFT DIAGRAM - RESISTANCE/SUPPORT CONCEPT\n\n### HIGH RESISTANCE\n**WHEN PRICE HEADS INTO THE PREMIUM AREA WHERE THERE'RE ALL THE BEARISH LEVELS (BARRIERS (PREMIUM PDAS))**\n\n*Bearish Premium Array (breaker, orderblock, etc.)*\n\n### LOW RESISTANCE RUN\n**UNTIL PRICE GOES INTO THE PREMIUM SIDE OF THE RANGE AND REACHES PREMIUM BEARISH LEVELS.**\n\n---\n\n## MIDDLE CHART - RESISTANCE ZONES WITH BREAKERS\n\n### HIGH RESISTANCE\n- *-breaker-*\n- *-breaker-*\n\n### LOW RESISTANCE\n**TILL FIRST BEARISH ARRAY IS REACHED**\n\n[Chart shows candlestick pattern with price moving from low resistance zone (gray/teal) through breakers into high resistance zone (pink/mauve)]\n\n---\n\n## RIGHT CHART - TREND REVERSAL\n\n### LOW RESISTANCE\n**TILL FIRST BULLISH ARRAY IS REACHED**\n\n*+DE*\n\n### HIGH RESISTANCE\n\n[Chart shows candlestick pattern with uptrend moving from high resistance zone (pink) into low resistance zone (gray/teal) with subsequent downtrend]\n\n---\n\n**VISUAL ELEMENTS:**\n- Pink/Mauve zones = High Resistance areas\n- Gray/Teal zones = Low Resistance areas\n- Candlestick charts showing price action\n- Horizontal lines marking key levels\n- Breaker annotations on middle chart\n- +DE marker on right chart\n\nBAIT AND SLAM\nWhenever you see price not showing any directional one-sided moves, when the \nmomentum is low and price is either forming double, triple bottoms or price \nforms a low then a small higher high & higher low close to it, then another one \u2013\nit\u2019s like the markets are laying cheese below it \u2013 that\u2019s what we target, that\u2019s \nwhat we focus on while retail traders try to trade away from it!\nIt\u2019s a smart idea to build a totally separate folder just for Liquidity.\nDo your analysis, explain to yourself what you think happened there save & \ncollect screenshots like that, it will help you to understand where the price is \ndrawn to, which areas act like \u201cmagnet\u201d.\n\n# BLESSED TRADER.\n**Your guide to consistency in the industry of loss.**\n\n---\n\n## LEFT DIAGRAM - PROTECTED LOW\n\n**Label:** \"PROTECTED LOW\"\n\n**Annotations:**\n- \"RUN ON STOPS\" (at bottom left)\n- \"BREAK OF STRUCTURE\" (dashed horizontal line at top)\n- Boxed area highlighting the low point\n\n**Explanatory text:**\n\"Price swept the SSLQ expanded higher broke the structure respecting bullish levels (bullish orderflow).\"\n\n---\n\n## MIDDLE DIAGRAM - LONG SETUP\n\n**Annotations:**\n- \"Long at P.D.

Very \nimportant rule to remember is that higher time-frames are like a \u201cparent\u201d figure \nto the lower ones, meaning that if the 1H orderflow is bullish but there\u2019s a 5min \nconsolidation that is building buy-side liquidity above and sell-side liquidity below \nthere\u2019s a big chance that both sides will get swept, however, the overall direction \nwill stay bullish.\nTo sum up, if we have a clear Daily target that is higher, the 1H orderflow is \nbullish, and 5min time-frame is stuck in a range (example on the right) \u2013 price \nwill sweep both sides but keep on going higher until the Daily target is reached \nand or 1H bullish orderflow & structure is broken.\n\nWhere do we look for liquidity despite, clean lows, equal \nlows, consolidations, etc.?\n- Highs & Lows of Asia Session: 08:00 PM to 00:00 AM NY time\n- Highs & Lows of London Session: 02:00 AM to 05:00 AM NY time\n- Highs & Lows of NY Session: 07:00 AM to 10:00 AM NY time\n- Intra-day Highs & Lows before Equity Opening: 09:30 AM NY time\n\nPrice needs to sweep Liquidity before every strong move \nthat\u2019s directional & momentum driven.\nBefore every one-sided, strong move the \u201cInformed Money\u201d will grab the liquidity \nthat\u2019s resting above the highs or below the lows (where retail traders place their \nstop losses) to be able to open large positions.\nWe use this to our advantage by letting price run those Liquidity Pools into one of \nthe levels like a bearish Orderblock (example on the right).\nNotice how aggressively price moves away from that area, that\u2019s the clearest & \nmost obvious sign that the \u201cSmart Money\u201d is involved \u2013 price has to run the stops \nand quickly move away from that area.\nIMPORTANT: when price runs a liquidity pool we want to see a strong expansion to \nthe opposite direction right away, if price is not in a rush to leave the liquidity \npool that\u2019s the first sign that price is NOT ready to go. Informed money will hold \nthe price there till there\u2019s enough liquidity swept to take off.\n\n# TRADING CHART CONTENT EXTRACTION\n\n## Header/Branding\n**BLESSED TRADER.**\n\"Your guide to consistency in the industry of loss.\"\n\n## Chart Annotations\n\n### Annotation 1 (Upper Right Area):\n**RUN ON BSLQ / STOPS**\nRun on the Buyside Liquidity (BSLQ)\nbefore expanding lower.\n\n### Annotation 2 (Middle Left Area):\n**RUN ON SSLQ / STOPS**\nRun on the Sellside Liquidity (SSLQ)\nbefore expanding higher.\n\n## Visual Elements on Chart\n\n### Marked Areas:\n- **Pink/Purple shaded rectangular zones** (3 visible):\n  1.

Uninformed money provides \nliquidity for the market makers.\nSo, two scenarios will happen from there \u2013 if it\u2019s a let\u2019s say \n5/15min trendline but the 1H, 4H orderflow is bullish, the market \nmakers will drag the price lower, sweep all the retail stops, and \naggressively push higher. Another scenario \u2013 as the retail crowd \nhave no understanding about the Premium/Discount Liquidity \nMatrix, retail traders will keep on buying in the Premium area, and \nthey\u2019re not aware that price reached a strong Premium Array, \nlevel like a bearish \u2013OB, and then from the price is just going to \ncollapse on them and reverse completely.\n\nInstitutional Order Flow\nWhen we\u2019re looking at the institutional order flow, you have to think like a market \nmaker \u2013 where is the maximum level of Liquidity in relationship with where the \nmarkets traded from and where it\u2019s at right now.\nScenario on the right: market created this huge imbalance by going down really fast, \nthen they filled it by coming back + reached and rejected the bearish orderblock. \nSo from there where\u2019s the biggest amount of liquidity resting? \nRight below the equal lows.\n\nInstitutional Levels (Big Figures)\nInstitutional levels & big figures are another draw on liquidity. Usually we line it up \nwith a few other confluence factors like Premium/Discount arrays, Fibonacci \nextension levels, external liquidity, and so on.\nThe levels you need to pay attention to are the big figures that end with: 0 / 2 / 6 / 8.\nPrice will always gravitate towards these levels. Few totally different examples \nusing these numbers: 1.00; 1.0200; 0.9600; 2.800.\nWhen you see a big figure like let\u2019s say 1.200 \u2013 if price is trending up/down towards it, \ndraw a 4 x 10 pip boxes up/down using the drawing tools, then line it up with all the \nother confluence factors - these are your exit points.\nPrice in most cases won\u2019t go more than 40 pips above/below the big figure without \nretracing back into the newly created range.\n\n# TRANSCRIPTION OF VISIBLE CONTENT\n\n## Main Title:\n**BLESSED TRADER.**\n\n## Subtitle/Tagline:\n*Your guide to consistency in the industry of fake.*\n\n## Visual Elements:\n- Series of moon phase images showing eclipse progression (5 phases from left to right: crescent, partial eclipse with glow, total eclipse with corona, partial eclipse, crescent)\n- Black background\n- White text\n- Celestial/astronomical themed design\n\n---\n\n**NOTE:** This appears to be a title/splash screen or cover page.
