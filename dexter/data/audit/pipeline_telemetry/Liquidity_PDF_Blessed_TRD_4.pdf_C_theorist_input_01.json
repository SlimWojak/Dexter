Uninformed money provides \nliquidity for the market makers.\nSo, two scenarios will happen from there \u2013 if it\u2019s a let\u2019s say \n5/15min trendline but the 1H, 4H orderflow is bullish, the market \nmakers will drag the price lower, sweep all the retail stops, and \naggressively push higher. Another scenario \u2013 as the retail crowd \nhave no understanding about the Premium/Discount Liquidity \nMatrix, retail traders will keep on buying in the Premium area, and \nthey\u2019re not aware that price reached a strong Premium Array, \nlevel like a bearish \u2013OB, and then from the price is just going to \ncollapse on them and reverse completely.\n\nInstitutional Order Flow\nWhen we\u2019re looking at the institutional order flow, you have to think like a market \nmaker \u2013 where is the maximum level of Liquidity in relationship with where the \nmarkets traded from and where it\u2019s at right now.\nScenario on the right: market created this huge imbalance by going down really fast, \nthen they filled it by coming back + reached and rejected the bearish orderblock. \nSo from there where\u2019s the biggest amount of liquidity resting? \nRight below the equal lows.\n\nInstitutional Levels (Big Figures)\nInstitutional levels & big figures are another draw on liquidity. Usually we line it up \nwith a few other confluence factors like Premium/Discount arrays, Fibonacci \nextension levels, external liquidity, and so on.\nThe levels you need to pay attention to are the big figures that end with: 0 / 2 / 6 / 8.\nPrice will always gravitate towards these levels. Few totally different examples \nusing these numbers: 1.00; 1.0200; 0.9600; 2.800.\nWhen you see a big figure like let\u2019s say 1.200 \u2013 if price is trending up/down towards it, \ndraw a 4 x 10 pip boxes up/down using the drawing tools, then line it up with all the \nother confluence factors - these are your exit points.\nPrice in most cases won\u2019t go more than 40 pips above/below the big figure without \nretracing back into the newly created range.\n\n# TRANSCRIPTION OF VISIBLE CONTENT\n\n## Main Title:\n**BLESSED TRADER.**\n\n## Subtitle/Tagline:\n*Your guide to consistency in the industry of fake.*\n\n## Visual Elements:\n- Series of moon phase images showing eclipse progression (5 phases from left to right: crescent, partial eclipse with glow, total eclipse with corona, partial eclipse, crescent)\n- Black background\n- White text\n- Celestial/astronomical themed imagery\n\n---\n\n**NOTE:** This appears to be a title/splash screen or cover page.
