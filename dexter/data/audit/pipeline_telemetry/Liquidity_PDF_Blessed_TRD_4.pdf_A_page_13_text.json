Very \nimportant rule to remember is that higher time-frames are like a \u201cparent\u201d figure \nto the lower ones, meaning that if the 1H orderflow is bullish but there\u2019s a 5min \nconsolidation that is building buy-side liquidity above and sell-side liquidity below \nthere\u2019s a big chance that both sides will get swept, however, the overall direction \nwill stay bullish.\nTo sum up, if we have a clear Daily target that is higher, the 1H orderflow is \nbullish, and 5min time-frame is stuck in a range (example on the right) \u2013 price \nwill sweep both sides but keep on going higher until the Daily target is reached \nand or 1H bullish orderflow & structure is broken.",
